# <img src="icon.png" width="30"> Pico Light Show

**Project Description:**

**PicoLightShow** is a project that utilizes the **Raspberry Pi Pico** microcontroller to create stunning light effects using **WS2812 LED strips**. This project is designed to allow users to easily control and configure various light effects through an integrated web server.

## Main Features:

- **Light Effects Generation:** The Raspberry Pi Pico controls WS2812 LED strips, enabling the creation of various light effects such as color transitions, blinking, waves, and other dynamic patterns.
- **Web Server:** An integrated web server allows users to connect to the Raspberry Pi Pico via Wi-Fi and control the light effects using a simple web interface.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly change light effect settings without the need for programming.

## Technical Specifications:

- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico
- **LED Strips:** WS2812 (addressable RGB LEDs)
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi (as an access point or connect to Wi-Fi network)
- **Web Server:** Hosted on the Raspberry Pi Pico, accessible via a web browser
